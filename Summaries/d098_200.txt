 Space Telescope Opening a Window on the 
Beginning of Time
 Hubble has been waiting to take its 
place in space since 1983, delayed by technical problems and the Challenger 
accident.
 The problem was overcome and the 
shuttle lifted off at 8:34 a.m. EDT, about three minutes late.
 The observatory is considered the 
greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo first used a telescope in 1609.
 Hubble also is expected to shed light 
on how and when the universe might end.
 Discovery's astronauts overcame balky 
equipment to send the Hubble Space Telescope floating free from the shuttle 
today on a 15-year quest for secrets of the universe.
 The $1.5 billion telescope began 
orbiting Earth every 97.3 minutes at an altitude of 380 miles _ high above the 
atmosphere, which has limited the view of ground-based telecopes.
 The $1.5 billion telescope was 
released at 3:38 p.m. EDT as the shuttle entered its 20th orbit of Earth, nearly 
two hours and one orbit later than planned.
 The Hubble Space Telescope orbited 
with its big eye open Friday after ground controllers overcame communications 
problems and lifted its lens cover, but its electronics were shut down due to a 
malfunction.
 Discovery is to land at 9:48 a.m. EDT 
Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
